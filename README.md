# BigQuery - Loans Dataset
## Objective:
Explore BigQuery capabilities to study the geography of loans in Wisconsin and make predictions about loan amounts. Combine data from various sources, including a public BigQuery dataset, HDMA loans dataset, and loan applications via a Google form.

## Implementation:
Utilize a Jupyter notebook (p8.ipynb) to answer 10 questions, covering tasks such as spatial joins, dataset creation, external table linkage, and linear regression modeling. Employ BigQuery to execute queries, assess costs, and analyze loan-related datasets.

## Setup:
Ensure JupyterLab is running directly on your VM without Docker containers. Install necessary packages and grant VM permissions for BigQuery and Google Drive access. Set up an SSH tunnel and connect to create Jupyter notebook. 

## Outcome:
The project showcases proficiency in leveraging BigQuery for complex data tasks, from spatial analysis and machine learning to dataset creation and external table linkage. The linear regression model's accuracy is thoroughly interpreted, providing insights into its predictive capabilities. Additionally, an analysis of the costs associated with BigQuery queries is presented, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the financial aspects involved in executing queries on large datasets. The results offer valuable insights into loan data geography and predictive modeling, foundational concepts in grasping BigQuery.
